# ESP-32 EDUCATIONAL PROJECT
The idea is to create a simple clock that also displays the temperature using multiple ESP32 features, such as dual-core, internet connection, internal RTC, I2C, and interrupts.
Future features:
- Interrupt dictating what is being displayed in the OLED.
- Dividing the task of displaying and the task of fetching the values for each core (just to use parallel programming).
- Connect it to the internet so it's a proper clock and not a chronometer.
